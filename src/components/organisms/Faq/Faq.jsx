            answer: `We are an international organization whose main objective is the national registry of animals (companion animals, in captivity, wild and cattle). In charge of developing standards related to animal identification and traceability, it helps Member Countries and Territories to establish animal identification and traceability systems in order to increase the effectiveness of disease prevention and control policies and activities.`,
