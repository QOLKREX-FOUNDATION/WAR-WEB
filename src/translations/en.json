  "For years, we have witnessed the deterioration of the animal situation worldwide: from the lack of empathy, irresponsibility, abandonment, to the cruelty towards animals. As the years passed, we tried to find a way to progressively curb the impact of the increasing number of animals in a state of abandonment, mistreatment, extinction, and overproduction. What were we missing? A measurement system that relies on the formalization of responsible owners for each animal. That's how the World Animal Registry was created. We are a decentralized international organization that works on formalizing the registration of animals to strengthen the responsible animal ownership system worldwide.": "For years, we have witnessed the deterioration of the animal situation worldwide: from the lack of empathy, irresponsibility, abandonment, to the cruelty towards animals.
